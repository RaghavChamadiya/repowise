## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Proactive context enrichment via Claude Code hooks** — `repowise init` now registers PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. PreToolUse enriches every `Grep`/`Glob` call with graph context (importers, dependencies, symbols, git signals) at ~24ms latency. PostToolUse detects git commits and notifies the agent when the wiki is stale.
- **`repowise augment` CLI command** — hook-driven context enrichment engine. Reads Claude Code hook payloads from stdin, queries local wiki.db, and returns enriched context as JSON. Not meant to be called manually.
- **`install_claude_code_hooks()`** — idempotent hook registration in `mcp_config.py`. Merges repowise hooks into existing user hooks without clobbering.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **`annotate_file` MCP tool** — attach human-authored notes to any wiki page. Notes survive LLM-driven re-generation and appear in `get_context` responses and the web UI. Pass an empty string to clear notes.
- **`repowise export --full`** — full JSON export now includes decision records, dead code findings, git hotspots, and per-page provenance metadata (confidence, freshness, model, provider).
- **Rust import resolution** — `use crate::`, `super::`, and `self::` imports now resolve to local files via crate root detection (`lib.rs`/`main.rs`). External crates mapped to `external:` nodes.
- **Go import resolution** — `go.mod` module path parsing enables accurate local vs external package classification. Local imports resolve by suffix matching against the module path.
- **C/C++ parser improvements** — added captures for `template_declaration`, `type_definition` (typedef struct/enum), `preproc_def` (#define), `preproc_function_def`, and forward declarations.
- **Go parser** — added `const_spec` and `var_spec` captures for package-level constants and variables.
- **Rust parser** — added `macro_definition` capture for `macro_rules!` macros.
- **Dynamic import detection** — dead code analysis now scans for `importlib.import_module()` and `__import__()` calls; files in the same package receive reduced confidence (capped at 0.4).
- **Framework decorator awareness** — Flask, FastAPI, and Django route/endpoint decorators added to `_FRAMEWORK_DECORATORS`. Decorated functions are never flagged as dead code.
- **`human_notes` column on wiki pages** — persists across re-indexing. Alembic migration `0014_page_human_notes`.
- **Decision staleness scoring during ingestion** — `compute_staleness()` now runs during `repowise init`, not just `repowise update`.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md template** — replaced imperative "MUST use" / "CRITICAL" language with advisory framing. Added `indexed_commit` display. Made `update_decision_records` optional ("SHOULD for architectural changes").
- **`get_context` freshness** — freshness data now included by default instead of requiring explicit `include=["freshness"]`.
- **`get_answer` docstring** — removed "do NOT verify by Read" instruction. High-confidence note changed to "verify cited file paths exist before acting on them".
- **Token budget caps** — `get_overview` caps knowledge_silos (30), module_pages (20), entry_points (15). `get_why` caps file_commits (10).
- **Dead code patterns** — expanded `_DEFAULT_DYNAMIC_PATTERNS` with `*Mixin`, `*Command`, `*_view`, `*_endpoint`, `*_route`, `*_callback`, `*_signal`, `*_task`.

### Docs
- **README** — tool count updated to 11, `annotate_file` added to MCP tools table, `--full` export flag documented, dynamic import detection noted, comparison table updated.
- **Supported languages** — tiered table with accurate "What works" descriptions per language.
- Updated USER_GUIDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and deep-dives.md to reflect all changes.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Traversal stats** — `FileTraverser` now tracks skip reasons (`.gitignore`, blocked extension, binary, oversized, generated, `--exclude`, `.repowiseIgnore`, unknown language) via a new `TraversalStats` dataclass. Stats are surfaced after traversal as a filtering summary showing how many files were included vs excluded and why.
- **Submodule handling** — git submodule directories (parsed from `.gitmodules`) are now excluded by default during traversal. Added `--include-submodules` flag to `repowise init` to opt in.
- **Language breakdown** — generation plan table now shows language distribution (e.g. "Languages: python 79%, typescript 14%"). Completion panel shows top languages with percentages instead of just a count.
- **Multi-line exclude input** — interactive advanced mode now prompts for exclude patterns one per line instead of comma-separated on a single line.
- 10 new unit tests covering `TraversalStats` counters, language counts, and submodule handling.

### Changed
- Traverse progress bar uses spinner mode instead of showing misleading pre-filter totals (e.g. "2132/83601").
- Traverse phase label changed from "Traversing files..." to "Scanning & filtering files...".

### Docs
- Updated README CLI reference with `--index-only`, `-x`, and `--include-submodules` examples.
- Updated website docs (`cli-reference.md`, `configuration.md`, `getting-started.md`) with submodule handling, `.gitignore` documentation, and new output examples.
- Reorganized `docs/` directory: architecture docs into `docs/architecture/`, internals into `docs/internals/`.
- Removed stale one-time documents (PHASE_5_5_IMPLEMENTATION, GIT_INTELLIGENCE_AUDIT, MCP_AND_STATE_REVIEW, MCP_TOOLS_TEST_REPORT).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **`get_answer` MCP tool** (`tool_answer.py`) — single-call RAG over the wiki layer. Runs retrieval, gates synthesis on top-hit dominance ratio, and returns a 2–5 sentence answer with concrete file/symbol citations plus a `confidence` label. High-confidence responses can be cited directly without verification reads. Backed by an `AnswerCache` table so repeated questions on the same repository cost nothing on the second call.
- **`get_symbol` MCP tool** (`tool_symbol.py`) — resolves a fully-qualified symbol id (`path::Class::method`, also accepts `Class.method`) to its source body, signature, file location, line range, and docstring. Returns the rich source-line signature (with base classes, decorators, and full type annotations preserved) instead of the stripped DB form.
- **`Page.summary` column** — short LLM-extracted summary (1–3 sentences) attached to every wiki page during generation. Used by `get_context` to keep context payloads bounded on dense files. Added by alembic migration `0012_page_summary`.
- **`AnswerCache` table** — memoised `get_answer` responses keyed by `(repository_id, question_hash)` plus the provider/model used. Added by alembic migration `0013_answer_cache`. Cache entries are repository-scoped and invalidated by re-indexing.
- **Test files in the wiki** — `page_generator._is_significant_file()` now treats any file tagged `is_test=True` (with at least one extracted symbol) as significant, regardless of PageRank. Test files have near-zero centrality because nothing imports them back, but they answer "what test exercises X" / "where is Y verified" questions; the doc layer is the right place to surface those. Filtering remains available via `--skip-tests`.
- **Overview dashboard** (`/repos/[id]/overview`) — new landing page for each repository with:
  - Health score ring (composite of doc coverage, freshness, dead code, hotspot density, silo risk)
  - Attention panel highlighting items needing action (stale docs, high-risk hotspots, dead code)
  - Language donut chart, ownership treemap, hotspots mini-list
  - Decisions timeline, module minimap (interactive graph summary)
  - Quick actions panel (sync, full re-index, generate CLAUDE.md, export)
  - Active job banner with live progress polling
- **Background pipeline execution** — `POST /api/repos/{id}/sync` and `POST /api/repos/{id}/full-resync` now launch the full pipeline in the background instead of only creating a pending job. Concurrent runs on the same repo return HTTP 409.
- **Shared persistence layer** (`core/pipeline/persist.py`) — `persist_pipeline_result()` extracted from CLI, reused by both CLI and server job executor
- **Job executor** (`server/job_executor.py`) — background task that runs `run_pipeline()`, writes progress to the `GenerationJob` table, and persists all results
- **Server crash recovery** — stale `running` jobs are reset to `failed` on server startup
- **Async pipeline improvements** — `asyncio.wrap_future` for file I/O, `asyncio.to_thread` for graph building and thread pool shutdown, periodic `asyncio.sleep(0)` yields during parsing
- **Health score utility** (`web/src/lib/utils/health-score.ts`) — composite health score computation, attention item builder, and language aggregation for the overview dashboard

### Changed
- **`get_context` default is now `compact=True`** — drops the `structure` block, the `imported_by` list, and per-symbol docstring/end-line fields to keep the response under ~10K characters. Pass `compact=False` for the full payload (e.g. when you specifically need import-graph dependents on a large file).
- `init_cmd.py` refactored to use shared `persist_pipeline_result()` instead of inline persistence logic
- Pipeline orchestrator uses async-friendly patterns to keep the event loop responsive during ingestion
- Sidebar and mobile nav updated to include "Overview" link

- Monorepo scaffold: uv workspace with `packages/core`, `packages/cli`, `packages/server`, `packages/web`
- Provider abstraction layer: `BaseProvider`, `GeneratedResponse`, `ProviderError`, `RateLimitError`
- `AnthropicProvider` with prompt caching support
- `OpenAIProvider` with OpenAI Chat Completions API
- `OllamaProvider` for local offline inference (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- `LiteLLMProvider` for 100+ models via LiteLLM proxy
- `MockProvider` for testing without API keys
- `RateLimiter`: async sliding-window RPM + TPM limits with exponential backoff
- `ProviderRegistry`: dynamic provider loading with custom provider registration
- CI pipeline: GitHub Actions matrix on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Pre-commit hooks: ruff lint + format, mypy, standard file checks
- **Folder exclusion** — three-layer system for skipping paths during ingestion:
  - `FileTraverser(extra_exclude_patterns=[...])` — pass gitignore-style patterns at construction time; applied to both directory pruning and file-level filtering
  - Per-directory `.repowiseIgnore` — traverser loads one from each visited directory (like git's per-directory `.gitignore`); patterns are relative to that directory and cached for efficiency
  - `repowise init --exclude/-x PATTERN` — repeatable CLI flag; patterns are merged with `exclude_patterns` from `config.yaml` and persisted back to `.repowise/config.yaml`
  - `repowise update` reads `exclude_patterns` from `config.yaml` automatically
  - Web UI **Excluded Paths** section on `/repos/[id]/settings`: chip editor, Enter-to-add input, six quick-add suggestions (`vendor/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `*.generated.*`, `**/fixtures/**`), empty-state message, gitignore-syntax tooltip; saved via `PATCH /api/repos/{id}` as `settings.exclude_patterns`
  - `helpers.save_config()` now round-trips `config.yaml` to preserve all existing keys when updating provider/model/embedder; accepts optional `exclude_patterns` keyword argument
  - `scheduler.py` logs `repo.settings.exclude_patterns` in polling fallback as preparation for future full-sync wiring
- 13 new unit tests in `tests/unit/ingestion/test_traverser.py` covering `extra_exclude_patterns` and per-directory `.repowiseIgnore` behaviour
